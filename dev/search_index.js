Can perform either an F or a Chisquared test. Returns a NamedTuple with the standard error, the Chisquared/F value, a p-value, the type of test performed, and the 5% critical value.\n\nArgs:\n\nlhs::Vector:This corresponds to the hypothesis matrix. If you want to test whether b2 + 2* b3 = b4 and you have 5 coefficents from b1 to b5 (note the intercept counts as one of these coefficents) you would specify it as [0, 1, 2, -1 0]\nrhs::Number: The value that the above linear equation should equal to under the null.\ncoef::Vector{Number}: A vector of estimates for (b1, b2, b3 etc)\nvcov::Matrix{Float64}: A variance covariance matrix.\ndof: The residual degrees of freedom. If these are not supplied a Chisquared Test will be performed.\ntest: One of \"F\" for an F-test or \"C\" for a Chisquared test.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"}]
